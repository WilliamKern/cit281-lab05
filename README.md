# CIT 281 Lab 05

## Overview  
Lab 05 introduced the concept of JavaScript classes and class inheritance. I created a parent class with properties and methods and then extended that class using the `extends` and `super` keywords to build a child class. This lab focused on reinforcing object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and method overriding in a practical, hands-on way.

## Objectives  
- Create a JavaScript class with a constructor and multiple methods  
- Use `extends` to create a subclass that inherits from a parent class  
- Apply `super()` to access the parent class's constructor  
- Override methods to change behavior in the subclass  
- Demonstrate usage by creating and interacting with class instances

## Deliverables  
- A `.js` file containing:
  - A base class with defined properties and behaviors
  - A subclass that modifies or extends functionality
  - Console output showing the creation and usage of objects from both classes

## What I Learned  
This lab helped solidify my understanding of how inheritance works in JavaScript. I learned how to build on existing functionality using the `extends` keyword, and how to use `super()` to properly initialize inherited properties. It also clarified the importance of class structure when designing scalable, modular code.
